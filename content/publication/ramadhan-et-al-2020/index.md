abstract: We derive rigorous upper bounds on the transport, for solutions of the Lorenz equations without assuming statistical stationarity. The bounds are saturated by nontrivial steady (albeit often unstable) states, and hence they are sharp. Moreover, using an optimal control formulation we prove that no other flow protocol of the same strength produces higher transport.
