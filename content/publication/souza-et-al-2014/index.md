abstract: This paper presents predictions of x-ray scattering spectra for warm dense matter. The authors use advanced theoretical models to simulate the x-ray scattering spectra and compare them with experimental data. The results provide insights into the properties of warm dense matter and help improve the accuracy of x-ray scattering techniques used in high-energy-density physics.
