abstract: We introduce an approach for analyzing the responses of dynamical systems to external perturbations that combines score-based generative modeling with the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, especially for systems with non-Gaussian statistics, often encountered in dynamical systems far from equilibrium. Such cases often present limitations for conventional approximate methods. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from a stochastic partial differential equation where the score function is available analytically. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our methodology over conventional methods and its potential as a versatile tool for understanding complex dynamical systems. Applications span disciplines from climate science and finance to neuroscience.
