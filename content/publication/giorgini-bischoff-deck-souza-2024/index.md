abstract: We introduce an approach for analyzing the responses of dynamical systems to external pertur-bations that combines score-based generative modeling with the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
(FDT). The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, notably for systems with non-Gaussian statistics, which can present challenges for conventional approximate methods. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from a stochastic partial differential equation where the score and response functions are available analytically. Furthermore, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our methodology over conventional methods and its potential as a versatile tool for understanding complex dynamical systems. Applications span disciplines from climate science and finance to neuroscience.
