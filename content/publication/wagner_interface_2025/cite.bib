  abstract = {We describe the vision, user interface, governing equations, and numerical methods that underpin new ocean modeling software called "Oceananigans". Oceananigans is being developed by the Climate Modeling Alliance as part of a larger project to build a trainable climate model with quantifiable uncertainty. We argue that Oceananigans' status as a popular, capable modeling system realizes a vision for accelerating progress in Earth system modeling that balances demands for model accuracy and performance, needed for state-of-the-art science, against accessibility, which is needed to accelerate development. This vision combines three cooperative elements: (i) a relatively simple finite volume algorithm (ii) optimized for high-resolution simulations on GPUs which is (iii) exposed behind an expressive, high-level user interface (using the Julia programming language in our case). We offer evidence for the vision's potential by illustrating the creative potential of our user interface, showcasing Oceananigans' physics with example simulations that range from simple classroom problems to a realistic global ocean simulation spanning all scales of oceanic fluid motion, and describing advances in parameterization, numerical methods, and computational efficiency.},
