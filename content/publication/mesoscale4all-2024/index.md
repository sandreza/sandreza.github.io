abstract: This preprint presents a GPU-based ocean dynamical core designed for routine mesoscale-resolving climate simulations. The core leverages GPU acceleration to provide high-resolution, efficient simulations of ocean dynamics, making it suitable for large-scale climate models. The development and performance evaluation of this core are discussed, demonstrating its ability to resolve mesoscale processes and improve the accuracy of climate simulations while reducing computational costs.
