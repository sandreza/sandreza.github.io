abstract: This paper investigates the optimal transport problem in two dimensions, specifically focusing on wall-to-wall transport. Using advanced mathematical techniques, the authors derive optimal solutions and provide insights into the nature of transport in fluid dynamics. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of transport phenomena and offer potential applications in various fields of fluid mechanics.
